# CSV Import Example

The file `quotes_dataset-partial.csv` is from https://github.com/ShivaliGoel/Quotes-500K

The original file contains around 500K quotes and takes sometime to load. You can use the partial CSV file for testing.

# The theme

Use [quotesin](https://wordpress.org/themes/quotesin/) theme to get a nice view of the quotes imported using these files.
